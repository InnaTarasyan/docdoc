This Laravel-based project is designed to fetch comprehensive healthcare provider data from the official NPI Registry API and store it in a structured and scalable way. The primary goal is to collect and organize information about doctors, healthcare organizations, and their specialties, making it easy to search, analyze, and use in medical directories or booking platforms.
